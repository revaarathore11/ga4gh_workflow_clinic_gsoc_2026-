# Contributing

Your contributions are welcome and necessary. Please use the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ga4gh/ga4gh_workflow_clinic_gsoc_2026/issues) to:

- Report bugs
- Propose or implement features
- Submit code changes / fixes
- Discuss code

See here for a [short tutorial for GitHub's issue tracking
system](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Please adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Please *do not* ask usage questions, installation problems (unless they appear
to be bugs) etc. via the GitHub issue tracker. We will set up a dedicated Q&A
channel soon.

## Reporting bugs

Please use the project's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/ga4gh/ga4gh_workflow_clinic_gsoc_2026/issues) to report
bugs. If you have no experience in filing bug reports, see e.g.,
[these recommendations by the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines)
first. Briefly, it is important that bug reports contain enough detail,
background and, if applicable, _minimal_ reproducible sample code. Tell us
what you expect to happen, and what actually does happen.

## Implementing features and submitting fixes

Kindly use pull requests to submit changes to the code base. But please note
that this project is driven by a community that likes to act on consensus. So
in your own best interest, before just firing off a pull request after a lot of
work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ga4gh/ga4gh_workflow_clinic_gsoc_2026/issues)
to **discuss your proposed changes first**. Afterwards, please stick to the
following simple rules to make sure your pull request will indeed be merged:

1. Major changes to the core `WorkflowBundle` data models should be discussed in an issue before implementation.
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from branch `main`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests under the `tests/` directory.
4. Ensure that all tests and quality checks pass locally:
   * `pytest` (runs the test suite)
   * `ruff check .` (linter check)
   * `mypy src/` (type check)
5. Document your code and update all relevant documentation.
6. Stick to the code and documentation style (see below).
7. Issue the pull request.

Important: Note that all your contributions are understood to be covered by the [same Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE) that covers the entire project.

## Code & documentation style

### Python

Please use a recent version of Python 3.12 or higher. Python code, docstring and
comment style loosely follows the
[Google Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md).
Please conform to this style to maintain consistency. Include type hints/annotations for all function/method signatures.

Please run the following validation tools locally and ensure that no warnings/errors are reported before you commit:

- [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) (for linting and formatting check: run `ruff check .` and `ruff format .`)
- [`mypy`](https://github.com/python/mypy) (for strict type checking)
